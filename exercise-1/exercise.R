# Exercise 1: Data Frame Practice

# Install devtools package: allows installations from GitHub
install.packages('devtools')

# Install "fueleconomy" package from GitHub
devtools::install_github("hadley/fueleconomy")

# Require/library the fueleconomy package
library("fueleconomy")
library("dplyr")
# You should have have access to the `vehicles` data.frame
View(vehicles)

# Create a data.frame of vehicles from 1997
vehicles.1997 <- filter(vehicles, year == 1997)

# Use the `unique` function to verify that there is only 1 value in the `year` column of your new data.frame
unique(vehicles.1997$year)

# Create a data.frame of 2-Wheel Drive vehicles that get more than 20 miles/gallon in the city
wheel.drive <- filter(vehicles, drive == "2-Wheel Drive", cty > 20)

# Of those vehicles, what is the vehicle ID of the vehicle with the worst hwy mpg?
worst.hwy.mpg <- filter(wheel.drive, hwy == max(hwy)) %>% select(id)

# Write a function that takes a `year` and a `make` as parameters, and returns 
# The vehicle that gets the most hwy miles/gallon of vehicles of that make in that year
MostHwyMpg <- function(my.make, my.year) {
  filtered <- vehicles[vehicles$make == my.make & vehicles$year == my.year, ]
  return(filtered[filtered$hwy == max(filtered$hwy)])
}

# What was the most efficient honda model of 1995?
MostHwyMpg("Honda", 1995)
